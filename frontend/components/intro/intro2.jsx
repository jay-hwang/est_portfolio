            I have been passionate about fighting human trafficking, and active in abolition work for over 8 years now. I have gone from being desperate to raid brothels to rescue women and children, to understanding more the complexities of human trafficking. In this blog, I hope to share a bit about my journey to help others understand the plethora of problems in tackling trafficking and about how you can get involved effectively.

// I am a graduate of Sussex University in Anthropology and Cultural Studies, with a Professional Certificate in Tackling Human Trafficking from the International Centre of Parliamentary Studies and a Certificate in Ending Slavery: Strategies for Contemporary Global Abolition from Nottingham University. I have been passionate about learning about human trafficking and getting involved in abolition work for over 8 years now, and I have gone from a place where I was desperate to raid brothels to rescue women and children, to understanding more the complexities of human trafficking. In this blog I hope to share a bit about my journey and help others to understand the plethora of problems in tackling trafficking and how you can get involved effectively.
