          This blog highlights some of the issues we face in tackling human trafficking in 2017. A lot of organisations post about ‘rescuing’ women from brothels, but that only skims the surface of the issue. There are so many issues that come alongside.Trafficking is the second most profitable global crime network, and involves millions of people. It is interweaved with so many factors; economic, social and more that cannot be reduced to ‘rescuing’ someone one night.This blog aims to break down some of these challenges and highlight the complexities of tackling human trafficking.
